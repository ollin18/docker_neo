# My favorite docker image for Neo4j 3.3.0 is here!
I've made some arrangements such as changing the ports in case you already have a Neo4j instance running,
APOC and Shell-Tools are enabled and the memory is upgraded to 2gb in case you have a large database.
Enjoy like I do.

# Note that you have use ports http=7475, bolt=7476
